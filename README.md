# Foreword For Learning SpringBoot
The following is just the list ofthings that you need to know before going for SpringBoot framework.

# Java Essentials To Know Beforehand

- [ ] **Java Basics:** You should have a good understanding of Java fundamentals such as variables, data types, control structures, object-oriented programming concepts, and exception handling.

- [ ] **Java Collections Framework:** You should know the basics of Java collections framework and the most commonly used data structures like lists, sets, maps, etc.

- [ ] **Java Annotations:** Spring Boot makes heavy use of annotations, so it's essential to understand how they work and how to use them effectively.

- [ ] **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):** You should be familiar with JDBC API, which is used to connect and interact with a relational database from Java applications.

- [ ] **Java Persistence API (JPA):** Spring Boot includes support for JPA, which is a standard interface for managing relational data in Java.

- [ ] **Spring Framework:** Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, so you should have a good understanding of the core Spring concepts such as inversion of control, dependency injection, and AOP.

- [ ] **RESTful Web Services:** Spring Boot makes it easy to build RESTful web services, so you should have a good understanding of the HTTP protocol and RESTful architecture.

- [ ] **Spring MVC:** Spring Boot includes support for Spring MVC, which is a powerful framework for building web applications.

- [ ] **Spring Data:** Spring Boot includes support for Spring Data, which is a powerful framework for working with data stores like databases, NoSQL data stores, etc.

- [ ] **Build Tools:** You should be familiar with build tools such as Maven or Gradle, which are used to manage dependencies, compile code, and build executable applications.

# SpringBoot Roadmap
> This is focused on learning how to build a REST API and a webpage server.

## Introduction
- [ ] Overview of Spring Boot and its key features
- [ ] Installing Java, Spring Boot, and any other necessary tools
- [ ] Creating a new Spring Boot project using a template or starting from scratch
## Building a Web Server for Serving HTML Pages
- [ ] Understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [ ] Setting up a basic HTML page and serving it with Spring Boot
- [ ] Adding CSS and JavaScript to enhance the UI
- [ ] Configuring Spring Boot to serve static resources such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files
- [ ] Templating Engines like Thymeleaf, Freemarker and Jade
## Building a RESTful API
- [ ] Understanding RESTful web services and HTTP methods
- [ ] Creating a basic RESTful API endpoint with Spring Boot
- [ ] Handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- [ ] Using Spring Data JPA to interact with a database and expose CRUD operations through the API
- [ ] Securing the API with Spring Security
## Advanced Topics
- [ ] Integration with other popular frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js
- [ ] Scaling a Spring Boot application with containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques such as caching and lazy loading
- [ ] Handling errors and exceptions in a Spring Boot application
- [ ] Testing Spring Boot applications with JUnit, Mockito, and other testing frameworks

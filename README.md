# Java Essentials To Know Beforehand

- [ ] **Java Basics:** You should have a good understanding of Java fundamentals such as variables, data types, control structures, object-oriented programming concepts, and exception handling.

- [ ] **Java Collections Framework:** You should know the basics of Java collections framework and the most commonly used data structures like lists, sets, maps, etc.

- [ ] **Java Annotations:** Spring Boot makes heavy use of annotations, so it's essential to understand how they work and how to use them effectively.

- [ ] **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):** You should be familiar with JDBC API, which is used to connect and interact with a relational database from Java applications.

- [ ] **Java Persistence API (JPA):** Spring Boot includes support for JPA, which is a standard interface for managing relational data in Java.

- [ ] **Spring Framework:** Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, so you should have a good understanding of the core Spring concepts such as inversion of control, dependency injection, and AOP.

- [ ] **RESTful Web Services:** Spring Boot makes it easy to build RESTful web services, so you should have a good understanding of the HTTP protocol and RESTful architecture.

- [ ] **Spring MVC:** Spring Boot includes support for Spring MVC, which is a powerful framework for building web applications.

- [ ] **Spring Data:** Spring Boot includes support for Spring Data, which is a powerful framework for working with data stores like databases, NoSQL data stores, etc.

- [ ] **Build Tools:** You should be familiar with build tools such as Maven or Gradle, which are used to manage dependencies, compile code, and build executable applications.
